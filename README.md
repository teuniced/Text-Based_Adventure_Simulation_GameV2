(CHOICES!) V2.0
STORY
Random things - good, bad, and neutral - happen all the time, for no other reason than the indeterminate randomness of the universe. Life is all about the choices we make.' The decisions we take every day, whether small or big, impact our lives in one way or another.


GAME MAP V1.0
The characters in this game can loop between three central locations, much like a normal average person would in real life (Home to various locations and back home (or not) depending on the player of the decision makes). The first function creates a [life ()] intro location for both players, allowing players to select a character before moving on to the following areas. Another place where everything comes to an end is the function exitlife (), where the character dies, and money is donated to charity. As with any regular existence, certain variables are defined. Variables like health points, money, or things used daily, etc.
